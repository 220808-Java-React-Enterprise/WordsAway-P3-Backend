Words Away V2 is a Social Media application centered on everyone's favorite game Word Away. Make friends, view user profiles, hang out in persistent chat rooms, and on top of all that, play a game of Words Away. V2 will add social media aspects to the Words Away digital board game. Additionally, the game will be polished and given a facelift, the user experience smoothed out, and quality of life features will be added.

- Players can register with a username, email, and password.
- Players will be able to start a game with a CPU.
- Players are able to start a game with another user
- Each player has a “tray” of 7 letters that they can make words from.
- Each time a letter is played, a new letter is drawn to replace it.
- A player can skip their turn to shuffle their letters back in and receive 7 new letters.
- A player can play a fireball if they have one instead of a word.
- Once all the opponent’s worms have been destroyed, the remaining player is the winner.
